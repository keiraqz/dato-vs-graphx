# Dato vs. GraphX
Some naive comparisons of two graph processing tools: Dato vs Spark GraphX. 
Thanks to <a href= "http://insightdataengineering.com/" target="_blank">Insight Data Engineering Fellow Program</a> for providing the cluster to run these experiments.

##AWS Cluster

All the experiments are run on a cluster with 1 master node and 3 work nodes on <a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS</a>. Each nodes is a m4.large instances with 8GB of RAM with 2 cores. 


##Dato
<a href= "https://dato.com/" target="_blank">Dato</a> is a graph-based, asynchronous, high performance, distributed computation framework written in C++. Dato provides 30-days free trial of accessing their products. You can download the free trial by registering <a href= "https://dato.com/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.  Following covers the basic of setting up Dato Distributed on AWS.

- **GraphLab Create:** You need to install GraphLab Create on a local machine to be able to interact with a distributed Dato cluster. To install, simply follow <a href= "https://dato.com/download/install-graphlab-create.html" target="_blank">Dato installation guide</a>. Here, I will also provide the basic steps to set things up in Linux environment.
  - Downlaod: Assume that you have registered with your email and have received a product key.
    - run ```sudo pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir https://get.dato.com/GraphLab-Create/1.6.1/EMAIL/PRODUCT_KEY/GraphLab-Create-License.tar.gz```
    - Replace EMAIL and PRODUCT_KEY with your personal information and let Dato take care of the rest
  - Test the Installation: For more details, please visit <a href= "https://dato.com/learn/userguide/install.html" target="_blank">GraphLab Create Getting Started</a>.

    ```{python}
    import graphlab as gl
    url = 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dato-datasets/millionsong/song_data.csv'
    songs = gl.SFrame.read_csv(url)
    songs['year'].mean()
    
    # Regression Model:
    url = 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/dato-datasets/regression/Housing.csv'
    x = gl.SFrame.read_csv(url)
    m = gl.linear_regression.create(x, target='price')
    ```

- **Dato Distributed:** After you have GraphLab Create installed, now you can move on to install Dato Distributed on a cluster. You will need to download Dato Distributed on your cluster as well as your personalized license file: Dato-Distributed-Services.ini. Here I will go through the basic steps for setting up Dato Distributed on a Hadoop cluster. For more details, please visit <a href= "https://dato.com/learn/userguide/deployment/pipeline-hadoop-setup.html" target="_blank">Setting up Dato Distributed on Hadoop</a>.
  - Deploy Dato Distributed: Go to Dato Distributed directory

    ```{engine='sh'}
    ./setup_dato-distributed.sh -d <HDFS_DIR_FOR_INSTALL_DATO> (eg. hdfs://your_cluster_ip:9000/dato/tmp)
                                -k dato_license.ini 
                                -c <HADOOP_BIN_PATH> (eg. /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop)
                                -p <NODE_TMP_DIR> (eg. /mnt/my-data/dato/tmp)
    ```
  - Test the cluster
    ```{python}
    import graphlab as gl

    # Create cluster
    c = gl.deploy.hadoop_cluster.create(name='test-cluster',
                                dato_dist_path='hdfs://your_cluster_ip:9000/dato/tmp',
                                hadoop_conf_dir='/usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop',
                                num_containers=3)
    print c
    ```

##GraphX
<a href= "https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/graphx-programming-guide.html" target="_blank">GraphX</a> is the new (alpha) Spark (written in Scala) API for graphs and graph-parallel computation. At a high-level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD by introducing the Resilient Distributed Property Graph: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge. You will be able to run GraphX after installing Spark.
- To use GraphX, simply import the packages in Spark: 
 
  ```{scala}
  import org.apache.spark._
  import org.apache.spark.graphx._
  ```

##Experiments

**Graph Algorithms:** Both Dato and GraphX have graph algorithms Triangle-counting, PageRank and Connected Components. The experiments will be testing all three algorithms on the following datasets. The sample code can be found: <a href= "https://github.com/keiraqz/dato-vs-graphx/blob/master/dato-dist.py" target="_blank">here</a> for Dato and <a href= "https://github.com/keiraqz/dato-vs-graphx/blob/master/graphx.scala" target="_blank">here</a> for GraphX. The expriments all start with default settings. GraphX is set to 1G per executor memory. Dato has total 4G for GRAPHLAB\_FILEIO\_MAXIMUM\_CACHE\_CAPACITY. GraphX is later set to 2G per executor memory.

**Dataset:**
The graph datasets are downloaded from <a href= "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/" target="_blank">Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP)</a>. In these experiments, following 4 datasets were used:
- Facebook: <a href= "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html" target="_blank">facebook_combined.txt.gz</a>
  + Nodes: 4039 | Edges: 88234 | Number of triangles: 1612010
- YouTube: <a href= "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Youtube.html" target="_blank">com-youtube.ungraph.txt.gz</a>
  + Nodes: 1134890 | Edges: 2987624 | Number of triangles: 3056386
- Pokec: <a href= "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-pokec.html" target="_blank">soc-pokec-relationships.txt.gz</a>
  + Nodes: 1632803 | Edges: 30622564 | Number of triangles: 32557458
- LiveJournal: <a href= "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-LiveJournal.html" target="_blank">com-lj.ungraph.txt.gz</a>
  + Nodes: 3997962 | Edges: 34681189 | Number of triangles: 177820130

All the datasets are in the format of: [source][(delimiter)][destiny]. An example of downloading the datasets from Linux command line:
  - Download: ```wget https://snap.stanford.edu/data/facebook_combined.txt.gz```
  - Unzip: ```gunzip facebook_combined.txt.gz```


##Results
- Triangle Counting
  - For Triangle Counting, both Dato and GraphX (if it finishes the job) returns the correct answer as listed on the SNAP website.
